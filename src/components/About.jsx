      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
      For years, I worked as a mix/mastering engineer, turning raw recordings into polished, release-ready music. But I kept running into the limitations of existing music software, so I decided to do something about it. That’s when I discovered software engineering. What started as a way to improve my tools became a full-blown passion for building and problem-solving.

Now, I’m wrapping up the Springboard Software Engineering Career Track, where I’ve been sharpening my skills in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and more. My capstone project is a music collaboration platform, designed to connect artists and producers effortlessly.

I thrive on creativity, innovation, and making things work better. Whether it’s a song mix or a software project, I bring a blend of technical expertise and artistic intuition to everything I build.
