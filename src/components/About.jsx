      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        For years, I worked as a mix/mastering engineer, turning raw recordings into polished, release-ready music. 
        But I kept running into the limitations of existing music software, so I decided to do something about it. 
        That’s when I discovered software engineering. What started as a way to improve my creative tools became a full-blown passion 
        for building, problem-solving, and crafting intuitive digital experiences.
        <br /><br />
        Today, I’m a <strong>Software Engineer at De Cima Law Firm</strong>, where I lead the development of the firm’s official website and internal tools. 
        I design and implement <strong>modern, responsive applications</strong> using technologies like <strong>React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB</strong>. 
        My focus is on building secure, scalable, and visually engaging web experiences that make a real impact on how the firm connects with clients.
        <br /><br />
        I recently completed the <strong>Springboard Software Engineering Career Track</strong>, where I honed my skills in <strong>JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and SQL</strong>. 
        My capstone project—a <strong>music collaboration platform</strong>—blends my background in music with my technical expertise, 
        helping artists and producers discover and collaborate through AI-driven mood tagging.
        <br /><br />
        I thrive on creativity, innovation, and making things work better. Whether it’s designing a client-facing web app or perfecting a song mix, 
        I bring the same attention to detail, curiosity, and passion for creating meaningful experiences.
